Party AI Control for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
=======

Allows you to toggle AI control for party members and summons through the in-game context menu.  

Requires the [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/ositools) & [LeaderLib](https://github.com/LaughingLeader-DOS2-Mods/LeaderLib).

# Features:  

* Toggle AI control for party members and summons through the in-game context menu (right click on a character in keyboard + mouse mode, or open the context menu with the controller).
* Party members under AI control will be limited to using 1 consumable per turn. This is to avoid the AI using up all your potions/etc.
* AI control is only enabled when in combat. This allows you to make your whole party be controlled by AI, if you want, since you can still control your characters outside of combat.
